# Bike Sharing project
Portfolio Project to showcase skills

## Scenario
As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, my role is crucial in achieving the company's future success. 
The director of marketing has emphasized the importance of maximizing the number of annual memberships. To accomplish this goal, our team aims to gain a deep understanding 
of the distinct usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic bikes. Armed with these insights, we will develop a comprehensive marketing strategy 
aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members. However, before presenting our recommendations, they must be supported by compelling data insights and presented 
through professional data visualizations. The final approval of our recommendations lies with Cyclistic executives, emphasizing the significance of thorough analysis 
and impactful visualizations in our work.

## Business Task
Understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to design a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
